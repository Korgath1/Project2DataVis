Potential improvements:
1. Live updates on the dashboards using an API
2. Page to upload CSVs with the same column types
3. More data: traffic volume, world region, or even past records on drivers like DUIs

From Lab 4.3, I changed the data because I wanted something different on traffic. 
I thought the previous dataset with music was not as fun as it could be. 
Music is constantly changing, and it was not as fun working with a dataset that was so old. 
Comparatively traffic data stays relatively similar from year to year.

This project now includes a gallery, a dashboard, and a selected insights page that answers the rubric directly. 
I learned from previous projects how to set up a dynamic path to the data, which I had troubleshooting with last time. 
This project is much more interactive, and you can really cut at the data from any direction unlike the work on the last lab.
