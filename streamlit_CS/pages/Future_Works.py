Potential improvements;
1. Live updates on the dashboards using an API
2. Page to upload CSVs with the same collumn types
3. More data, traffic volume, world region, or even past records on drivers. It would be nice to know if the driver has gotten a DUI before or other tickets

From Lab 4.3 I changed the data, I wanted something different on traffic. I thought the dataset with music was not as fun as it could be.
Music for me is constantly changing and it was not as fun working with a dataset that was so old. Here, traffic data, stays pretty similar
from year to year. This project has a gallery, a dashboard, I even added a selected insights page that answers the rubric directly. It was refreshing
to work with new data. I learned from previous projects how to set up a dynamic path to the data which I had a hard time troubleshooting last time.
This project I think is much more interactive and you can really cut at the data from any direction unlike the work on the last lab.
